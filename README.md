# üè° HDB Resale Flat Prices

## üóì About
I was deciding recently between getting a resale flat or a new flat from HDB. I eventually went with getting a new flat but I am keen to find out how the resale flats market is like. I also view this as an opportunity for me to practice applying what I have learnt from some courses I attended recently. I used Python for this project. 

## üî¢ Data
#### The following CSV files were downloaded from [data.gov.sg](https://www.data.gov.sg):

- Resale flat prices from 2000 to Feb 2012 
- Resale flat prices from Mar 2012 to Dec 2014
- Resale flat prices from Jan 2015 to Dec 2016
- Resale flat prices from Jan 2017 to date 

#### Following were the notes that came with this data set:
- The approximate floor area includes any recess area purchased, space adding item under HDB‚Äôs upgrading programmes, roof terrace, etc.
- The transactions exclude resale transactions that may not reflect the full market price such as resale between relatives and resale of part shares.
- Resale prices should be taken as indicative only as the resale prices agreed between buyers and sellers are dependent on many factors.
- "Remaining lease" is the number of years left before the lease ends. This information is computed as at the resale flat application.

#### I decided to focus on the years 2011 to 2021:
The resale flat scene has changed quite a bit from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. As Singapore's population becomes increasingly affluent and start having higher expectations of housing, I am curious about how the resale flat transactions are like in the more recent years.   

## üìù Goals
- Identify how resale flat prices changed over the years 2011 to 2021
- Identify how resale flat prices vary with the different characteristics of a flat
